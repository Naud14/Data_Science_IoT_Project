# Data_Science_IoT_Project
Final delivery for Data-Science project. 

## Introduction
Hi i'm Naud, a 20 year old Informatica student at Hogeschool Rotterdam and I participated the course Data-science for IoT. This github repository is my final delivery for this course. In this read-me file I will explain what the idea of this final project is, what my conclusion is and I will demonstrate in a short video what you can expect if you finish the tutorial! This explanation is meant for everyone (technical and non-technical people)!
For this project I have combined two courses, Django for webdevelopment and this course. 

## The idea
The idea of this project is to set up an website with the django-framework (Django is a high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development of secure and maintainable websites). For this project we are going to use a Raspberry Pi 4 for hosting this Django-website on a local network. 
After talking with a Kevin Krul (a Django expert), he advised me to host your django website on a local server instead of directly to the internet. 
The most imporant point to host via Raspberry Pi on your local network, and not host to 'the internet' is a security measure. If you host directly to the internet it is asked to be hacked. If you want to do that, you should use a hosting-provider like Azure or Heroku. 

!! You do not want to make a open an unsecure connection from your raspberry to the internet !!
