Final delivery for Data-Science project. 

## Introduction
Hi i'm Naud, a 20 year old Informatica student at Hogeschool Rotterdam and I participated the course Data-science for IoT. This github repository is my final delivery for this course. In this read-me file I will explain what the idea of this final project is, what my conclusion is and I will demonstrate in a short video what you can expect if you finish the tutorial! This explanation is meant for everyone (technical and non-technical people)!
