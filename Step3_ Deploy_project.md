# Deploy Django project on local network using Raspberry Pi
The final step is to deploy the Django project so we can access it from everywhere in our local network. 
Right now, only the Raspberry itself can access the project because it is an local host. 

## Local Host
For more information about local hosts, read this -> https://whatismyipaddress.com/localhost 
But in short: 

The localhost is the default name describing the local computer address also known as the loopback address. For example, typing: ping localhost would ping the local IP address of 127.0.0.1 (the loopback address). When setting up a web server or software on a web server, 127.0.0.1 is used to point the software to the local machine.
