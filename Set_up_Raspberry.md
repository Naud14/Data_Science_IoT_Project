# Set up Raspberry Pi 4 Computer Model B (4GB RAM)

We are going to set up the Raspberry Pi computer. First you need to download a couple programs and you need the following atributes: 
- Raspberry Pi 4
- Power adapter 
- External monitor
- External mouse 
- External keyboard
- MicroSD

And the following programs: 
- Raspberry Pi Imager -> https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/
- VNC viewer -> https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/

After doing that, we will write the MicroSD with the Raspberry Pi Imager (RPI). So open the RPI and use the settings in the picture below. Select your MicroSD card, enter schrijf (write) and enter your password. Writing the MicroSD can take a couple of minutes.

After this, we are going to try to make connection with the Raspberry Pi (RP). Put the MicroSD in your RP. Turn the power supply on and connect your monitor, mouse and keyboard to the RP.

When you connected everything, you should be able to see a 'home screen' on your monitor with a welcome message. Click 'Next', set your country, create a user, set up screen, select a wireless network (just use your WIFI), update software (or skip because this can take some time) and click 'restart' to restart your RP. 
Now you should be able to log in/or you are already logged in and see the screen below:

For now we are going to set up a connection to your laptop (using VNC viewer) so you do not have to connect an extern monitor/mouse/keyboard everytime.
